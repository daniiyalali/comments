## Grid System

Source: [Grid - Behaviors (Figma)](https://www.figma.com/design/1Op9CRCbOrgAt4yzR2yGWe/SMPLX-Design-System?node-id=209-597)

| Breakpoint | Width | Columns | Col Width | Margin | Gutter | Safe Area |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Mobile | 390px | 4 | 84px | 15px* | 8px | 360px |
| Tablet | 1024px | 12 | — | 20px | 12px | 984px |
| Desktop | 1440px | 12 | 100px | 32px (FLEX) | 16px | 1376px |
| Large Desktop | 1920px | 12 | 100px | 272px (FLEX) | 16px | 1376px |

*Figma specifies 15px mobile margin; we use 16px (`--spacing-16`) as the closest design token. Mobile safe area at 15px = 360px; at 16px = 358px.

**Desktop margin is FLEX:** At 1440px the margin is 32px. On viewports wider than 1440px, the margin grows to keep the 1376px safe area centered (e.g., 272px at 1920px). Implemented via `mx-auto`.

### Container Behavior Rules

- **Simple rule:** All content modules follow this grid unless they are product tiles. Parent container for product tiles will abide by the grid; tiles within will follow flex.
- **Navigation:** Fills all available horizontal space (full-width, edge-to-edge).
- **Container Type 1 (Editorial/Full-bleed):** Parent container's BACKGROUND will "FILL" all available space (edge-to-edge). Content within will always be bound by the grid limits (1376px safe area).
  - *Used for:* Navigation, Cover Story, Web Banner (Hero), Footer
- **Container Type 2 (Product/Card grids):** Parent container will respect the bounds of the grid with "FIXED" width. For Shop modules, the product tiles will have "FLEX" behavior.
  - *Used for:* Product tile grids, Trending Videos / carousels

### Implementation

- **One container for all pages:** `max-w-[1376px] mx-auto px-[var(--spacing-16)] tablet:px-[var(--spacing-32)]`
- There is no separate "homepage" container. The SMPLX grid (32px margin / 1376px safe area) is the single canonical grid for all pages.
- Use design system spacing tokens (`--spacing-16`, `--spacing-32`) — not arbitrary `px-4`, `px-8`.
- Use design system breakpoints (`tablet:`, `desktop:`) — not `md:` or `lg:`.

## Aspect Ratio System

### Design Rationale

The aspect ratio system is a **visual hierarchy tool**, not just an image sizing spec. The system uses **two levers** to communicate editorial importance: **ratio** (shape of the image) and **size** (physical dimensions / column width). On mobile, ratio controls viewport fill percentage — the most powerful hierarchy signal. On desktop, column span does the heavy lifting.

**Core principles:**
1. **Ratio communicates content type** (portrait editorial vs. landscape news). **Size communicates importance within a type** (lead card = wide column, supporting cards = narrow columns).
2. **The same ratio at different sizes creates clear hierarchy** without requiring multiple portrait ratios. A 4:5 card at 680px wide reads as dramatically more important than a 4:5 card at 340px wide.
3. **Aspect ratio varies by placement context**, not by content. The same article renders at different ratios depending on the module it appears in.

### Ratio Palette

| Ratio | CSS Value | Mobile Height (full-width, 390px) | Viewport Fill (~844px) | Role |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **4:5** | `aspect-ratio: 4/5` | 488px (full-width) / 325px (carousel card ~260px wide) | ~58% / ~38% | **Portrait tier** — all editorial module cards (leads and secondaries). Hierarchy expressed through size. |
| **16:9** | `aspect-ratio: 16/9` | 219px | ~26% | **Landscape tier** — feed cards, news grids, compact/secondary placements. Maximum scannability. |
| **1:1** | `aspect-ratio: 1/1` | 390px | ~46% | **Utility** — square content (album art, profile images, product shots). Not a tier assignment. |

**Why two ratios, not three:**
The previous 3-tier system used 3:4 (Showcase), 4:5 (Feature), and 16:9 (Standard). The 3:4 → 4:5 difference is only **6.25% in height** at any given width (e.g., 28px at 340px wide). This is not perceptible to users. Industry editorial design (NYT, The Atlantic, Pitchfork) universally uses a single portrait ratio and expresses hierarchy through column width. Collapsing to one portrait ratio (4:5) simplifies the system: one CMS crop target for portrait content, fewer design decisions per component, and hierarchy that's MORE legible through physical size difference rather than subtle shape change.

**Perceptual step between tiers (mobile):**
- Portrait (4:5 full-width, 488px) → Landscape (16:9, 219px): **~269px drop** — dramatic, unmistakable contrast
- Portrait carousel card (4:5 at ~260px wide, 325px) → Landscape (16:9, 219px): **~106px drop** — clear distinction

### Hero Treatment (Outside the Ratio System)

The Cover Story hero is **not a card** — it's a page-level event. It lives outside the ratio system and is defined by its **treatment** (full-bleed, viewport-filling, text overlay), not by a card ratio class.

| Breakpoint | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Mobile (390px) | Full-width, viewport-filling (~80-100vh) | Image crops to viewport. 9:16 is the approximate native proportion but is not enforced as a fixed ratio. |
| Tablet (1024px) | Full-width billboard | Same as desktop |
| Desktop (1440px) | Full-width billboard, 16:9 proportions | Full-bleed edge-to-edge, text overlay |

- **Frequency:** Single instance at top of page. Only one hero per page.
- **Content:** Cover stories, lead editorial, breaking news.
- **Why the hero isn't in the ratio system:** If the hero used 9:16 as a formal tier, any module that also used 9:16 would dilute the hero's supremacy. By keeping the hero as a special treatment (defined by position + full-bleed + overlay, not by ratio), nothing competes with it. The hero is supreme because of WHERE it is and HOW it's treated, not because of its shape.
- **Image requirement:** Separate mobile crop (`mobileImageUrl`) recommended for portrait framing. Source images must be >= 1200px wide (Google Discover).

### Visual Hierarchy Tiers

#### Portrait Tier (4:5)
**Purpose:** "This is curated." Editorial content with strong visual presence. Used for all module cards — hierarchy within modules is expressed through **column width**, not ratio change.

| Breakpoint | Ratio | Module Type | Cards Visible | Behavior |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Mobile (390px) | **4:5** | Horizontal carousel | ~1.4 cards (card width ~65% viewport + peek) | Swipe horizontally, peek of next card visible |
| Tablet (1024px) | **4:5** | 3-up grid | 3 cards | Static grid, no scroll |
| Desktop (1440px) | **4:5** | Lead + grid (5 articles) or equal grid | 5 cards | Static grid, no scroll |

- **Frequency:** Repeatable. Each channel/vertical can have its own module.
- **Content:** Channel highlights, editorial picks, curated selections, Lists, Features.
- **Ratio is constant across all breakpoints.** 4:5 is the portrait tier's visual identity. Module shape changes (carousel → grid), but ratio does not.
- **Size-based hierarchy within modules:**
  - **Lead card:** Wide column (~6 cols on desktop). Largest image = most important story in the module.
  - **Supporting cards:** Narrow columns (~3 cols each). Smaller images = secondary stories.
  - The lead card reads as dramatically more important than supporting cards through physical size alone — no ratio change needed.
- **Mobile carousel specs:**
  - Card width: ~65-70% of viewport (~250-270px)
  - Gap between cards: `var(--spacing-8)` (8px)
  - Peek of next card must be visible (minimum 40px of next card showing)
  - Headline + metadata below each card image
- **Desktop/Tablet grid specs:**
  - Cards placed within the 12-column grid
  - Desktop: Lead card spans 6 cols, supporting cards fill remaining cols
  - Tablet: 3 cols per card (3-up)
  - Gap: `var(--spacing-16)` (16px)

#### Landscape Tier (16:9)
**Purpose:** "Here's more." The workhorse format for feeds, news grids, and secondary placements. Maximum scannability — the reader's eye goes to the headline, not the image.

| Breakpoint | Ratio | Module Type | Behavior |
|---|---|---|---|
| Mobile (390px) | **16:9** | Vertical feed (image-above-text or image-beside-text) | Vertical scroll |
| Tablet (1024px) | **16:9** | Vertical feed | Vertical scroll |
| Desktop (1440px) | **16:9** | Horizontal cards (image-left, text-right) or grid | Vertical scroll |

- **Frequency:** Repeatable. Used for Latest Stories feed, Top Stories secondary grid, category page feeds.
- **Content:** Latest stories, all-channel feed, filtered content, Top Stories secondary cards.
- **16:9 is the existing workflow standard.** No migration cost — CMS, image pipeline, and editorial muscle memory are already built around this ratio.
- **Appropriate for news-driven modules** where scannability matters more than visual presence (Top Stories, Latest Stories Feed).

### Module Differentiation Strategy

Lists and Features modules MUST use different **layout structures** to prevent module monotony. Differentiation comes from card arrangement, typography weight, metadata density, and grid composition — not from aspect ratio.

| Module | Layout Pattern | Differentiator |
|---|---|---|
| **Latest Features** | Lead card (wide) + supporting grid | Editorial hierarchy — one story dominates |
| **Latest Lists** | Equal-width cards or numbered items | Democratic/ranked — content is the hierarchy |

The specific layout patterns for each module are defined during implementation, but the constraint is firm: consecutive modules must be visually distinguishable at a glance.

### Adjacency Rules

- **Recommended page rhythm:** Hero → Portrait modules → Landscape feed, with Portrait modules forming a browsable zone
- The hero is unique — only one per page, always at top
- **Consecutive Portrait (4:5) modules are acceptable** when they form a cohesive channel browsing zone (e.g., Lists → Features → Music → Style → Sneakers). Section headers and layout structure differences provide visual separation.
- **Module separators** (hairline rules) should be used between modules for visual closure, especially when modules have different internal heights.
- The "highs and lows" rhythm is achieved by the contrast between the hero treatment, Portrait editorial modules, and Landscape feed — not by varying ratios within the Portrait tier.

### Utility Ratios (Non-Tier)

These ratios are available for specific non-editorial content needs but are not tier assignments:

| Ratio | Usage | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1:1 | Square content (album art, profile images, specific product shots) | Content-specific, not a hierarchy signal |
| 9:16 | Video/story content (Trending Videos) | Not used for article card imagery |
| 4:5 (product) | Product tiles in shop modules | Existing shop usage; Portrait tier adoption creates visual consistency between editorial and commerce |

## Homepage Token Mapping (Homepage Redesign → SMPLX Design System)
